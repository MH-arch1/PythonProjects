# **Voting Eligibility Checker**

### Description

This Python program checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter their age.

It converts the input into an integer.

### Using conditional statements, it checks:

If the age is 18 or older, it prints that the person is eligible to vote.

If the age is under 18, it prints that the person is not eligible to vote yet.

### Example Usage

Enter your age: 20

You are eligible to vote!

### Pseudo Code

    BEGIN
    PRINT "Enter your age: "
    READ age
    CONVERT age to integer
    
    IF age >= 18 THEN
        PRINT "You are eligible to vote!"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Sorry, you are not eligible to vote yet."
    ENDIF
    END
